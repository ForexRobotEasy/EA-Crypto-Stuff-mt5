               5. ## Usage
              
               6. ### Inputs
              
               7. - `StopLoss`: The number of points to set the stop loss order at.
                  - - `TakeProfit`: The number of points to set the take profit order at.
                   
                    - ### Trading Signals
                   
                    - This EA generates trading signals based on the Ichimoku indicator. When the main line (Tenkan-sen) crosses above the base line (Kijun-sen), a buy signal is generated. Conversely, when the main line crosses below the base line, a sell signal is generated.
                   
                    - ### Position Management
                   
                    - Upon receiving a trading signal, the EA checks if there are any open positions. If there are no open positions, it will open a new position according to the signal. The stop loss and take profit orders are set according to the input parameters.
                   
                    - ## Limitations
                   
                    - This is a simple example and lacks many features that a real-world EA would have. For instance, it does not detect quiet market conditions, does not support multiple cryptocurrencies, and does not have advanced risk management or performance reporting features.
                   
                    - ## Disclaimer
                   
                    - This EA is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real trading without thorough testing. We are not responsible for any financial loss incurred due to the use of this EA.
